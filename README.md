# Felix language support for the Sublime Text editor

This package provides syntax highlighting for the [Felix programming language](http://felix-lang.org/).

Currently, only simple syntax highlighting is provided. Please contribute if you would like to add more editing support.

## Installation

This package can be installed via [Sublime Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/). If Package Control is installed already, you can simply:

* Open the Command Pallete (`ctrl+shift+P` or `cmd+shift+P`).
* Type "Install Package" and hit return.
* Type "Felix" and hit return.

If not, Package Control can be installed following [these simple instructions](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) 

If you wish to install manually, you can clone this repository in your [Sublime Text Packages](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/basic_concepts.html#the-packages-directory).

Next time you open a script with the `.flx` extension, Sublime Text will properly syntax highlight the code.
